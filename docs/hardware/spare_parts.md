# Spare Parts

## Spare Parts to Stock
In the following I'll list those kind of parts I personally would suggest to stock. I'll mostly list parts which aren't that expensive and pretty much known to fail sooner or later. Some of them count as consumables (like nozzles or v-slot wheels for example) and I highly recommend to have at least one or two items of them on stock, others are parts which are nice to have to be on the safe side if anything breaks.    
  
However, it does make sense to check whether it's cheaper to get certain parts on their own or to buy a complete spare part. As an example I'd mention the parts of the printhead here. If you'll get the fans, the thermistor, cartridge heater, heater block, hotend etc. as individual parts it most likely makes more sense to get yourself a complete new printhead as a spare part right away. Of course you still should get nozzles and silicone socks anyway, but if you'd have to pay pretty much the same or even more for some individual parts as for a complete printhead, why should you buy individual parts then? Remember that the whole printhead also includes the feeder gear, the plastic cover, the metal plate, the stepper motor and so on.  
Anyway - even though it most likely makes more sense to buy a complete printhead to have all the parts stocked, I'll list the imho most important parts from that device also individually.  

Consumables which you'll definitely need (sooner or later):  

  - Nozzle
  - PTFE tube (Neo) / bowden tube plus couplings (Go)
  - Silicone sock
  - V-slot wheel
  - Anti-backlash nut
  
Good to have because they will most likely fail when you really need the printer:  

  - Thermistor
  - Cartridge heater
  - Heater block 
  - Heatbreak 
  - Hotend
  - Belts
  - Heatsink fan / hotend fan
  - Part cooler fan
  - Part cooler fan duct

Of course you can also stock motors, a lead screw, a mainboard, a power supply unit, a control unit and so on, but in case something like that breaks you might also have other, more severe problems. Due to the fact that those parts aren't the cheapest ones to get, you probably want to get them at the time you need them.      
  
## Where to Get
When you need to change certain parts or you need to fix them, check out the [Anycubic site](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/for-kobra-series) and watch out for the correct printer model if you can find what you're looking for.  
  
However, there are only a few original spare parts available for the **Go** and the **Neo** at the time of writing this. But as you maybe read in the belonging sections, there are parts from other Kobra models which are just the same (e.g. the hotend from the Kobra and the Kobra **Neo**). Also many parts from third party manufacturers can be used as most of the parts are common components of these kinds of machines.  
  
So if you're looking for parts like v-slot wheels, belts, anti-backlash nuts, nozzles or even a new lead screw or motor for example, keep in mind that those aren't 'specific' parts most of the time - they're regular components. Have a look at the spare part you need and do a little research if it really is something 'special' that pretty much only Anycubic or authorized sellers are offering (like the mainboard), or if that's a 'regular' component and therefore could be found easily.
