# Introduction
Here you'll find further information about the [stock firmware](fw_marlin.md) of both the **Go** and the **Neo** - like how to install updates, information about specific settings and known restrictions.  
  
However, you might want to give [Klipper](fw_klipper.md) a try though, as it offers additional features like Pressure Advance and Input Shaping and offers much more possibilities to customize your firmware settings.  
It also keeps the z-offset (yes, also *after* proceeding an ABL sequence) and doesn't suffer from this special kind of "z-offset dementia" like the stock firmware sometimes does.    
I personally switched to Klipper and can highly recommend it.
