Informations, tips, tweaks and mods about and for the 3D FDM printer Anycubic Kobra Go and Neo to get off better from the start.
  
  
**Hi and welcome to my little page about the Anycubic Kobra Go and Kobra Neo.**  
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a **Kobra Neo** from a friend of mine. As it came with some problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the **Neo** - it turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family. So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the **Go** and **Neo** (as they are basically the same) to facilitate other newbies like me an easier start right away.  
  
If you'd like to contribute - please let me know. Especially for the **Go** I don't really have any content yet, so if you'd e.g. send me certain pictures taht would already be very helpful.     
You don't necessarily need a GitHub account for it if you don't want to register here for free, just send me an email to  <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` </br> and we'll figure something out.   
  
*I hope you'll find some useful informations around here - so: happy tinkering and printing!*
