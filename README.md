**Hi and welcome to my little page about the Anycubic Kobra Go and Kobra Neo.**  
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a **Kobra Neo** from a friend of mine.  
As it came with some minor problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the **Neo**. It turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family - most of the (still rare) informations were about the Kobra **Go**.  
So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the **Go** and **Neo** (as they are basically the same) to facilitate other newbies like me an easier start right away.

Happy printing!
