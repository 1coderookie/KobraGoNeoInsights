Depending on what you want do do now, you need to follow different steps. But first let's have a look at the coverless head from different points of view, starting with the view from the front with a straight look at the little fan for cooling the printed part. </p> <p><img alt="Front side view" src=../../assets/images/head_dis-front_web.jpg> <img alt="Fan parts" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_fan-parts_web.jpg> </p> <p>Now we look at the left side where you can see the motor of the feeder gear. You can spot three hexagon socket screws there - two at the top and one at the bottom close to the motor housing, which are holding the entire feeder system onto the metal backplate. </p> <p><img alt="Left side view" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_leftside_motor_mount_marked_web.jpg></p> <p>From the right side view you see the fan for cooling the heatsink and the ABL sensor with the orange tip at the very right side of the construction. </p> <p><img alt="Right side view" src=../../assets/images/head_rightside_web.jpg> <img alt="Fan heatsink" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_fan-heatsink_web.jpg></p> <p>Looking at the head from the bottom right side, you can see the fan outlet on the left, the hotend with the stock silicone sock and the orange tip of the ABL sensor. </p> <p><img alt="Bottom right side view" src=../../assets/images/head_bottom-view_web.jpg> <br> The following picture shows the whole metal plate where the feeder construction (the marked tips of the three screws on the right side) and the bracket of the ABL sensor (the two marked screws on the left side) is mounted onto - I took these pictures when the head wasn't mounted to the carrier of the x-axis so you can have a better look at the deatails. </p> <p><img alt="Backside view metal plate" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_backplate_marked_web.jpg></p> <p><em>You'll find further disassembling instructions for the ABL sensor, the feeder gear system and the hotend in the specific sections.</em> </p> <hr> <h3 id=mod-voron-stealthburner>MOD: Voron StealthBurner<a class=headerlink href=#mod-voron-stealthburner title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><a href=https://www.printables.com/de/@ZdenekKrupick_612132>Zdeněk Krupička</a> remixed an adapter for being able to use a <a href=https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner>Voron StealthBurner</a> printhead at the <strong>Neo</strong> while still using the stock ABL sensor: <a href=https://www.printables.com/de/model/553841-voron-stealthburner-adapter-for-anycubic-kobra-neo>Voron StealthBurner adapter for Anycubic Kobra Neo </a>. </p> <hr> <h2 id=abl-sensor>ABL Sensor<a class=headerlink href=#abl-sensor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Both printers come with an inductive proximity sensor for automatic bed levelling (ABL) which detects the metal of the spring steel PEI plate.<br> The ABL sensor is the part with that round orange tip, you can see a picture of it in the following sections for the specific printer model. At the <strong>Go</strong> it's located at the left hand side of the hotend, at the <strong>Neo</strong> it's located at the right hand side of the hotend when looking at the printhead from the front. </p> <p>The sensor is a <strong>PNP-NO</strong> type and works at 6-36V DC (I did some tests with 5V and it seemed to work, but you might face a decrease in the detection range if not even an unreliable behaviour). The connector is a XH 2.54 type. <br> The wiring is: </p> <ul> <li>brown = VCC 24VDC</li> <li>blue = GND</li> <li>black = LEVEL/signal </li> </ul> <details class=info> <summary>Spare Sensor</summary> <p>If you need a spare sensor and can't find it at Anycubic's online shop, you can first of all reach out to Anycubic directly and ask for it. They have some sort of internal shop system and will send you a link if they have this sensor available.<br> However, you can also get yourself a 'generic' PNP NO sensor instead. These ones are often slightly longer than the stock sensor though, so the printhead's cover will most likely not fit anymore, but that's not a problem. You can search for a <strong>"PNP NO LJ12A3-4-Z/BY"</strong> (PNP-NO, M12, 4mm detection range, 6-36V). </p> </details> <p>The position of the sensor (the height) should be adjusted in relation to the nozzle.<br> Therefore you can either use the ABL height gauge which sometimes comes with the printer or you can use the bigger one of the two-sided open ended wrench that comes in the toolset.<br> The following picture shows the height gauge that sometimes comes with the printer - if you don't have it and don't want to use the mentioned wrench, you can download <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0245/5519/2380/files/Height_gauge.rar?v=1667814312">the gcode file</a> from Anycubic's support page and print it. </p> <p><img alt="ABL height gauge" src=../../assets/images/abl-gauge_web.jpg></p> <p>The procedure about how to adjust the position will be described for the specific printer model in the following sections as well. </p> <details class=warning> <summary>Malfunction! - Common Issue: Broken Wiring!</summary> <p>It might (actually: most likely will) happen that sooner or later the ABL sensor will become faulty. In that case the LED of the sensor might light up when metal is being detected, but no signal will be passed to the mainboard and therefore the functionality itself isn't given anymore. </p> <p>This seems to be a quite common issue. The problem seems to be that the wiring of the sensor will break, due to the repetitive movement and bending of the wiring at a certain spot.<br> In most cases the breaking seems to take place at the spot where the cable of the sensor is being tied down with a zip tie to the metal plate of the printhead. At that spot the repetitive bending occurs and the starnds of the wires start to break. Since the wires are really thin, sooner or later the damage is severe enough to cause the malfunction.<br> In other cases the breaking took place right at the spot where the cable leaves the plastic cap of the sensor. </p> <p>If you encounter this problem, you might be able to identify the broken wiring by measuring the resistance of the wire, preferrably when slowly bending around the wires. If the resistance changes, you have a partially broken wiring. You could also try and probe for continuity first, but this might give you a false positive result, since one thin strand is enough to report continuity.<br> You then <em>might</em> be able to solve and fix it by cutting away the broken parts and reconnect the wires, but since the wires are really thin, it might be better to just get yourself a replacement sensor right away. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=go_1>Go<a class=headerlink href=#go_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The following picture shows the location of the ABL sensor at the printhead of the <strong>Go</strong>, looking at it from a bottom view angle - the ABL sensor is the part at the left side with the round orange tip. </p> <p><img alt="Orange tip of the ABL sensor at the right side" src=../../assets/images/head_go_bottom_web.jpg></p> <p>The ABL sensor itself is mounted in a plastic bracket which is the mounted to the metal backplate.

If you did so and were able to insert the filament but it seems that it's getting stuck lower down in the hotend, then you might hit the end of the nozzle with an edge of your filament. It helps when you cut the filament in a 45° angle and bend the part you're manually feeding into the hotend so that it's pretty straight.<br> If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere. To clean, inspect and maintain it, you need to disassemble the hotend.

You don't want the feeder gear to "bite" too much into the filament as well though, as this may lead to inconsistentites of the filament flow. I personally like to extrude a bit so that the gear actually has to pull it in. Then I do a cold pull and check the marks of the gear on the filament itself. If you can see and feel little marks of the teeth of the gear on the surface of the filament, then it should be ok. If you don't feel and see any marks, then it's too loose. PLA is pretty hard, so the pressure can/should be a bit higher as well, but if the marks are pretty deep, then it already might be too much. If the filament is already a bit squeezed and kinda flat, then it's definitely way too much pressure (you'll most likely experience some weird artefacts, inconcisties and patterns at your prints as well then). The filament should be fed reliably, which especially comes into account while retracting. So keep an eye on the shaft of the motor by looking at the back of the motor - if you notice that it's slipping while retracting, you definitely need to increase the tension.<br> As a rule of thumb you can keep in mind that the pressure should be higher when using hard filament like PLA and lower when using soft filament like TPU. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=go_2>Go<a class=headerlink href=#go_2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The following picture shows the bowden drive feeder system of the <strong>Go</strong>.

So I'll just quote his notes in the following: <br> "XCR3D Titan clone has some differences compared to the original E3D Titan Aero, and it's mostly due to the screws, and imo the XCR3D clone is flawed and is not as good as the original design.<br> The most important part is to make sure that the screws are not overtighened - it's part of the assembly process to make sure that the hobb gear runs smooth and that it does not bind.<br> Also, it's very important to align the pinion gear mounted on the stepper motor to be flush with the hobb gear - otherwise the lever arm will be out of alignment, or it will bind on the hobb gear.<br> So I'm not sure if Anycubic is not properly assembling the extruders, or if the screws get loose overtime causing issues with the lever arm going out of place etc, as I'm starting to see more and more posts on reddit of people complaining about extruder clicking noises on retracts, or the lever being slanted to the side.<br> So imo it's important people check their extruders and make sure to assemble them correctly.<br> Therefore I don't recommend the Titan metal arm and gear set upgrade kit, as it just doesn't fit exactly right in the XCR3D clone extruder used in the Kobra Neo. The good news is that one upgrade path is to install an original E3D Titan Aero, which also upgrades you to a proper E3D v6 hotend, or it's also possible to upgrade to a proper, high quality clone, such as one made by TriangleLabs (can be found on AliExpress).<br> I should also mention that the XCR3D clone is also sold by other names, such as 3DSWAY and LERDGE, and that bimetal heatbreak I'm using is sold by 3DSWAY which is a 1:1 drop in replacement and is a perfect fit - makes sense when you consider that they also sell the exact Titan Aero heatsink clone used in the Kobra Neo :)"</p> </details> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Retraction Settings</p> <p>Make sure that you set the retraction distance and speed to the correct values for a direct drive!<br> In general, it's supposed to be something around 1mm retraction distance for direct drive systems like the <strong>Neo</strong>. The profile from Anycubic has this setting set to 6mm though, which is <em>way</em> too much for the direct drive! If you set the distance to a value which is too high (e.g. the default 6mm for the <strong>Go</strong> as a bowden drive), the melted filament might be pulled back too far and reaches the PTFE tube which might get clogged then.<br> You can find some more information about this topic in the section <a href=../../calibration/#retraction-settings>"Retraction Settings"</a>.</p> </div> <details class=tip> <summary>Feeder Gear Pressure</summary> <p>When adjusting the pressure of the feeder gear, make sure you don't tighten it up too much as it could squeeze and deform the filament. On the other hand it shouldn't be too loose though as it should transport the filament reliably.<br> When pulling out the filament of the extruder system, you should notice little dents on the surface of the filament from the teeth of the feeder gear, the filament itself shouldn't be squeezed and deformed though, it should still be "round" so to say. You don't want the feeder gear to "bite" too much into the filament as well though, as this may lead to inconsistentites of the filament flow. I personally like to extrude a bit so that the gear actually has to pull it in. Then I do a cold pull and check the marks of the gear on the filament itself. If you can see and feel little marks of the teeth of the gear on the surface of the filament, then it should be ok. If you don't feel and see any marks, then it's too loose. PLA is pretty hard, so the pressure can/should be a bit higher as well, but if the marks are pretty deep, then it already might be too much. If the filament is already a bit squeezed and kinda flat, then it's definitely way too much pressure (you'll most likely experience some weird artefacts, inconcisties and patterns at your prints as well then). <br> The filament should be fed reliably, which especially comes into account while retracting. So keep an eye on the shaft of the motor by looking at the back of the motor - if you notice that it's slipping while retracting, you definitely need to increase the tension.<br> As a rule of thumb you can keep in mind that the pressure should be higher when using hard filament like PLA and lower when using soft filament like TPU. </p> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Print A Filament Guiding Sleeve</summary> <p>I printed a <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5720072>filament guiding sleeve</a> made by <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/fredfeuerstein2/designs>"fredfeuerstein2"</a> which sticks in the hole of the feeder gear system where the filament enters.

You might notice that in a specific area the extruder motor might skip and won't extrude filament - the following picture illustrates this problem. </p> <p><img alt="Broken wiring" src=../../assets/images/extr-wiring-broken_symptom_web.jpeg> </p> <p>You can see two short videos of how the extruder behave and skipped when the head was in a certain position in <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/1bybkbh/i_need_help_my_extruder_stops_working_on_the_left/ >this reddit post</a>. </p> <p>This seems to be a quite common issue (at least at the Neo). The problem seems to be that the wiring of the motor will break, due to the repetitive movement and bending of the wiring at a certain spot.<br> In most cases the breaking seems to take place at the spot where the cable package that contains all the wires of the head's parts is being tied down with a cable tie to the metal plate of the printhead. At that spot the repetitive bending occurs and the starnds of the wires start to break. Since the wires are really thin, sooner or later the damage is severe enough to cause malfunctions of the parts. </p> <p>If you encounter this problem, you might be able to identify the broken wiring by measuring the resistance of the wire, preferrably when slowly bending around the wires. If the resistance changes, you have a partially broken wiring. You could also try and probe for continuity first, but this might give you a false positive result, since one thin strand is enough to report continuity. </p> <p>If you face this issue, it's the best solution to just get yourself a new cable and replace the broken one. You can find according cables easily, just search for "stepper motor cable" for example. <br> Pay attention to the specs mentioned above and make sure to get a cable with the correct types of connectors and the sufficient length. Usually these kind of motor cables are available in lengths like 100cm, 150cm and 200cm, so just go with 150cm then. </p> <p>Before connecting the new cable, you need to check the wiring and make sure it fits the coils of the motor as shown in the following pictures.<br> A stepper motor has two coils and each coil has to be connected with the according wires. In the following pictures, those coils and according wires are marked green and red. </p> <p><img alt="Motor coils" src=../../assets/images/extruder_motor_marked_web.jpg><br> <img alt=Wiring src=../../assets/images/extruder-wiring_marked_web.jpg><br> <img alt=Wiring src=../../assets/images/extruder-wiring2_marked_web.jpg> </p> <p>Depending on the cable you actually got, it might be the case that you'd have to change the position of two or more wires in one of the connectors, because some stepper motors have the coils connected to different pins and therefore the connectors are populated with the wires being in a different position.<br> If you'd mix up the connections and connect one wire of the first coil to the second coil and vice versa, the motor wouldn't turn, it would make weird noises instead. </p> <p>If you have to change the position of wires, I'd suggest to do it at the 4pin XH 2.54 connector since it's a bit easier to handle.<br> When you look at the metal contacs as shown in the pictures above, you have to push down a little 'lever' for being able to pull the wire with the metal contact out of the plastic connector housing.<br> Use a pointy item like a toothpick or so, slightly push down that 'lever' and hold it like that while gently pulling out the wire.<br> Please be patient and careful and don't force it!<br> Sometimes the lever gets stuck and the contact won't come out, then just push the wire back in and try it again.<br> Once you have the wires pulled out, change the position accordingly and make sure the order fits the one of the stock wiring as shown in the picture above. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=hotend>Hotend<a class=headerlink href=#hotend title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>In the following, the specific hotends will be shown.

If you did so and were able to insert the filament but it seems that it's getting stuck lower down in the hotend, then you might hit the end of the nozzle with an edge of your filament. It helps when you cut the filament in a 45° angle and bend the part you're manually feeding into the hotend so that it's pretty straight.<br> If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere. To clean, inspect and maintain it, you need to disassemble the hotend. Check the section <a href=#disassembling-the-hotend>"Disassembling The Hotend"</a> further down below for more information. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Large Clump Of Melted Filament Built Up</summary> <p>Sometimes it may happen that melted filament builds up on top of the heater block to a large clump. The reason for that is that the heatbreak isn't screwed into the heater block tight enough so that the melted fiolament can squeeze out. It also may be caused by bad and cheap parts where the thread isn't just as good as it should be. <br> <img alt=Blob src=../../assets/images/head_blob_web.jpg> <br> So if you encouter this problem, here is what I recommend to do (based on my own experience with this dilemma). </p> <ul> <li>Take off the plastic cover first to get better access to the whole area. </li> <li>Heat up everthing - I did this by using the preherat function for PLA at the control unit.</li> <li>Once the filament starts to melt and gets soft, grab a wooden stick and take away as much as possible carefully. <em>Don't</em> use a screwdriver or something like that to do so as you might harm the wires and/or cause a shortcut at e.g. the contacts of the cartridge heater. <br> <em>Be really careful when taking away the clumps to not harm or rip off any of the wires!</em> You can also use a cloth to wipe off the melted filament from the heater block and so on, just make sure you don't burn yourself! </li> <li>For the next steps you need to be a bit quick in proceeding them, so if this is the first time you're diassembling the hotend, take a look at the sections here at the page and read them first so you'll know where the screws are located and which steps you need to take. Then proceed with the following steps.</li> <li>So, once everything is as clean as possible, turn off the printer and loosen the grub screws inside the heater block to take out the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Give it a quick wipe with the cloth if they're covered by a lot of filament, too (but don't waste too much time here as the filament is becoming hard again now pretty quick!). </li> <li>Then take out the nozzle from the heater block and unscrew the heater block from the hotend. Pay attention if you can feel that the heatbreak was loose in the heater block to check if that was the reason for the filament being able to squeeze out and build up. </li> <li>Dismount the fan on the right side and loosen the two hexagon socket screws which are holding the heatbreak in place. If it doesn't fall out by itself, pull it out. When using the <strong>Neo</strong>, make sure the little PTFE tube also comes out, take it out of the heatbreak. </li> <li>If you were using a cheap nozzle and have a spare one, just throw away the old one. If it's a good or your only nozzle, try to get it back to work again by giving it a proper cleaning and doing some cold pulls when it's installed again. </li> <li>Now put all the metal parts (heatbreak, heater block and probably the nozzle) in a glass with acetone. close the lid and let it sit there for about 24hrs. The acetone won't dissolve PLA filament or so automagically like it does with ABS, but it'll make it soft and easier to clean. </li> <li>In the meantime you can take care of the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Scratch off the hardened filament from the metal parts by using a cutter for example, but be <em>really</em> careful to not slip off and harm any wires! I personally didn't take care of the little clump at the part where ther wires are coming out of the metal part because I didn't wanted to risk harming the wires, so I just let it sit there. </li> <li>When you're about to clean the meatal parts which soaked in the acetone, I'd recommend wearing disposable gloves as acteone isn't really healthy for your skin. So put on those gloves and start cleaning the parts by carefully scratching off the rest of the filament. Use a cutter, a brass brush etc., but always be careful to not really harm anything. Pay special attention to all the threads and the holes of the heater block where the thermistor and the cartridge heater will take place. If you don't get everything cleaned up at the first time, just put it back in the acetone, wait again and then repeat the cleaning steps. </li> <li>Once everything looks nice and clean, rinse off the acetone with clear water and let it dry. This is especially important for the inner side of the nozzle - you don't want to have acetone in there. </li> <li>Then reassemble everything and put it back in place. Read the notes in the specific sections here about how to reassemble the specific parts and what to pay attention to. </li> <li>At the end when everything is reassembled and you heated up the hotend to finally mount the nozzle and load the filament, extrude filament to see if everything is ok. </li> <li>If so (I hope it will be!), don't start printing right away - execute a PID tuning for the hotend first. </li> <li>Also check if you need to re-level the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle due to a probably different position of the hotend now. </li> <li>Execute an ABL and take care of your Z-offset, most likely the position of your nozzle will be different due to a different position of the whole hotend. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h3 id=go_3>Go<a class=headerlink href=#go_3 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The hotend of the <strong>Go</strong> is shown in the next pictures.<br> The bowden tube from the feeder gear to the hotend is about 40cm long.<br> The first picture shows the hotend completely assembled as it comes as a spare part (I don't own the <strong>Go</strong>, so I had to buy a spare part hotend for taking these pictures), the second picture shows the hotend being dismounted from the aluminum heatsink. </p> <p><img alt=Hotend src=../../assets/images/head_go_hotend_web.jpg> </p> <p><img alt="Hotend disassembled" src=../../assets/images/head_go_hotend-dis_web.jpg></p> <hr> <h4 id=disassembling-the-hotend>Disassembling The Hotend<a class=headerlink href=#disassembling-the-hotend title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>If you need to dismount the hotend from the printhead to change it or if you need to disassemble it, check out the expandable textbox below for further instructions. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>When pulling out the hotend at the <strong>Neo</strong>, <em>make sure the PTFE tube placed in the heatbreak comes out, too!</em> </li> <li>Inspect the PTFE tube if it's burned, deformed or clogged - if so, get a new one as a replacement (I'd recommend using a Capricorn bowden tube).

Referring to them, the coating might be harmed when doing so. </p> </li> </ul> </details> <details class=info> <summary>About Nozzle Sizes</summary> <p>When it comes down to choose the right nozzle size, it all depends on what you want to print and how detailed it should be. The standard size of 0.4mm the printers come with is a good starting point.<br> However, you may find yourself in the situation that you want to print more detailed objects or objects which should be more sturdy or where it doesn't matter if the surface doesn't look as clean and flat as possible, so you probably should adjust the size and switch to a smaller oder bigger diameter like 0.2mm for high detailed objects and 0.6mm for the 'rougher' prints. <br> Keep in mind though that the printing time usually increases by choosing a smaller diameter and it decreases when you're using a bigger diameter.<br> The printing time as well as the quality also depends on the <a href=../../calibration/#layer-height>layer height</a> you're using, so by choosing a smaller layer height you can also get detailed and great looking prints with a 0.6mm nozzle.<br> Last but not least a smaller nozzle bore is more likely to clog and some filaments even have a sticker on the spool saying that e.g. it should be printed with minimum a 0.4mm nozzle. So choose wisely if you really want to use a nozzle with a 0.2mm bore for example. </p> <p>Search the web for more specific information about finding and choosing the right nozzle size for your project. You may want to start with this article from <a href=https://www.all3dp.com/2/3d-printer-nozzle-size-material-what-to-know-which-to-buy>All3DP: The Best 3D Printer Nozzle Types, Sizes &amp; Materials</a>. </p> <p>In the following I'll mention some aspects you should be aware of when choosing a different nozzle size, particularly when choosing a bigger nozzle. Most people seem to be stuck to the common 0.4 nozzle and don't seem to be aware of the fact that one can still get 'fine' detailed outcomes (more or less - of course there's a difference in the ability of printing super fine details when e.g. comparing a 0.2 to a 0.6 nozzle..) or 'even' surfaces with a bigger nozzle size as well if e.g. going with the same layer height.<br> The increased line width helps cutting down the printing time and makes prints even more rigid. </p> <p>For testing around just copy your existent profile and change the nozzle size in there. Save it as an own profile and start playing around. </p> <ul> <li>Printing temperature: when using a bigger nozzle, one needs to keep an eye on the printing temperature. The bigger the nozzle is, the more filament will flow thru the bore at the same time - and therefore less time it has to completely melt so to say. So instead of using the same temp like with the 0.4 nozzle, increase the temperature. How much that has to be depends on the diameter of the nozzle, the type of filament etc - so maybe start with increasing 5°C or 10°C and see how it turns out. </li> <li>Printing speed: the same as for the printing temp. Generally speaking, the faster you want to print, the hotter you have to print as well to compensate/reach the higher flowrate and have the same amount melted in the same time. I often see ppl going with e.g. 190-200° for PLA and trying to print at the max speeds the new K2 models can reach - that most likely doesn't work. Instead, increase the temp and/or decrease the speed. </li> </ul> <p>For both of these points there are somewhat limitations tho, so when e.g. printing small and thin parts you'll most likely run into issues when printing too fast as well as when printing too hot, as the material might not have enough time to cool down properly and therefore curls up or behaves weird in other ways. One can try to compensate that (besides choosing the suitable speed&amp;temp) by making use of the minimum layer time settings in the slicer. </p> <ul> <li>Retraction settings: you need to keep an eye on and dial in your retraction settings when using a bigger nozzle size. Try different retraction <em>speed</em> settings as well, not only retraction <em>distance</em>. </li> <li>Use the Arachne feature in your Slicer - Prusa has it and iirc also Cura has it.<br> That being said, when using a bigger nozzle, you might want to check if it makes sense to add one or two more walls. As most of the models are somewhat designed for being printed with the common 0.4 nozzle, I found that this comes into account when choosing the amount of walls and the percentage of the infill as well. So adding e.g. one more wall can often save you from printing any infill and you'll end up with a cleaner and even more rigid print. </li> <li>You can also take advantage of the feature "adaptive layer height". However, when doing so, keep an eye on the settings as you might reach the maximum flowrate (= limit) or even try to go beyond it. There are online calculators you can use where you type in the layer height, line width and printing speed and then you'll have the according flowrate calculated. </li> <li>There's a 'physical' limitation to what's possible in terms of maximum flowrate and even the thermal conductivity of the filament itself. So don't expect to successfully use a 1mm nozzle at 300mm/s printing speed printing huge models with super long layer lines from regular PLA - that most likely won't work out. There are a few things one could do when trying to really reach or even go beyond the limits, like using a CHT nozzle, using specific HighSpeed-filament and so on. </li> <li>I personally use plated copper heater blocks at my printers, even tho I'm not going for the highest possible speed.

Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so. </p> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Cleaning The Nozzle</summary> <ul> <li>For cleaning the nozzle and getting rid of excessive filament during the printing process or right before printing starts as the extruder is heating up, you can use a long and thin wooden stick like a skewer. A wooden toothpick also works fine - just make sure you don't burn yourself as it may be a bit short. I personally use these long pipe cleaners which have this kinda cotton stuff all around them. It doesn't melt when touching the hot nozzle and filament sticks great to it. </li> <li>Before and after each print I recommend to wipe away the melted filament at the nozzle with a 'cotton' pipe cleaner, a paper towel or a cloth - but <em>don't burn yourself!</em> This procedure keeps the nozzle clean and the rest of the filament won't burn black onto the brass which makes it hard to remove later. </li> <li>If the nozzle is already too smeared and has too much filament burnt onto the surface to be cleaned with a paper towel, you can use a small brass brush. Be careful though to not harm the tip of the nozzle by scrubbing too hard across it! Be careful to <em>not</em> touch any wires or contacts during brushing at it may cause a shortcut and blow off your mainboard! So I'd suggest you heat up the nozzle and then turn off the printer before starting to brush. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged, using a needle with the correct diameter to stick it into the hot nozzle for cleaning it sometimes works. Just stick in in the heatened up nozzle and poke around. Be careful to not harm the tip of the nozzle though! </li> <li>You can also use certain filament which is made for cleaning. You load it and let it run through. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged and therefore the cleaning filament can't run through, you could also try to do a <em>"cold pull"</em>. To do so you heat up the nozzle to about 220°C, load the cleaning filament and manually push it through a bit. Then let the nozzle cool down to about 90-100°C and rip out the filament. You may have to repeat this procedure a few times until the cleaning filament can run through again. However, be careful not to rip off the filament by doing the cold pull as you then definitely have to disassemble the hotend.<br> <em>Attention: don't do cold pulls when using any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! The manufacturers say that it might harm the coating of the inside of the nozzle!</em> </li> <li>If you still encounter problems with the flow of the filament though or if you even can't load new filament, most likely the little PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak is clogged. Scroll down to the "Disassembling" section where you'll find a little guide about how to get it out and clean it. </li> <li>If you took out the nozzle from the heater block and can't get it clean, heat it up with a hot air gun. Then you can poke out the soft filament. You can also try to put it in acetone and let it sit there - the longer the better (I'd say minimum 24hrs). This method works especially great with ABS as that just dissolves, but it also works at least a bit with other types of filament like PLA (although not as good as with ABS at all) and makes it a bit softer. Then you can try to poke the filament out. This also works with the heater block and the heatbreak if you want to clean them also. Make sure to rinse them with water before installing though. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h3 id=changing-the-nozzle>Changing The Nozzle<a class=headerlink href=#changing-the-nozzle title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If you need to change the nozzle, mind the warnings from above and check out the following steps in the expandable block below.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Never try to unscrew the nozzle from the heater block while the parts are cold!</em></strong> <br> Melted filament or some kind of screw lock glue will make it hard or even impossible to unscrew it and you risk to shear off the nozzle! </li> <li>Make sure you're holding the heater block tight to avoid <em>any</em> movement and don't overtighten the nozzle when installing it! <br> Reddit user <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/I_Sells_Drugs/ >I_Sells_Drugs</a> was so kind to allow me to show pictures of <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/10rf58m/does_this_mean_i_need_to_replace_entire_hotend/ >his attempt to tighten up the nozzle even more</a> as he got irritated by the little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block.

Don't fiddle around while it's turned on - in case you slip with the wrench and harm the wires you could create a shortcut which most likely will blow something up of your mainboard. </li> <li>Then grab the heater block with a wrench to hold it in place and screw out the nozzle carefully. Use a sufficient tool like a wrench or a socket wrench for the nozzle - don't use a pair of pliers as it may/will round off the screw nut. </li> <li>Make sure you don't turn the heater block at all to not loosen it from the heat break! Just hold it in place.</li> <li>If the nozzle won't come loose, heat up the extruder again, raise the temperature a bit and let it sit longer to melt the filament in the gaps which seems to block. Before trying to unscrew the nozzle, switch off the printer again. <br> If that still doesn't work, you could take a piece of damp cloth and hold it against the nozzle (<em>not</em> the heater block, <em>only the nozzle</em>!) for a moment to cool it down. Due to the sudden decrease of temperature the metal of the nozzle will contract a tiny bit which may result in being able to unscrew it. </li> <li>For installing the new nozzle, screw it in and turn it back about one rotation once you feel it hits the heatbreak. I personally do this after everything cooled down until it's safe to touch because then I can screw in the nozzle by hand and therefore I can feel right at the start if it doesn't sit correctly.</li> <li>Check if you didn't harm any wires! </li> <li>If everything is fine, power up the printer and heat up the extruder again. Most nozzle manufacturers say that you should heat it up to about 250°C, but that might already harm the PTFE tube. So go with 230-240°. </li> <li>Then carefully tighten up the nozzle, but don't overtighten it though. However, you need to make sure that it's tight enough (about 1.5NM) and that it really touches the heatbreak! There shouldn't be any gap between the heatbreak and the nozzle inside of the heater block! </li> <li>Don't get irritated by the fact that there's a little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block oncce you installed everything correctly - that's totally fine and it's supposed to be like that as the following picture shows. <br> <img alt="Mounted nozzle" src=../../assets/images/head_nozzle-mounted_web.jpg> </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h2 id=part-cooling-fan>Part Cooling Fan<a class=headerlink href=#part-cooling-fan title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The part cooling fans of the <strong>Go</strong> and the <strong>Neo</strong> are different. </p> <details class=note> <summary>Klipper: Try Different PWM Frequencies When Using A Different Fan</summary> <p>When you're using Klipper and a different part cooling fan from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party manufacturer (no matter if it's a 4510 or 5015) and you still face issues with the PWM behaviour of the fan, try different settings for the PWM frequency, which is the setting "cycle_time" in Klipper.<br> By default, Klipper is using 100Hz, but due to the setting in the stock firmware, 20kHz (= 0.00005 cycle_time) is being set here in the <code>printer.cfg</code>: <br> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><a id=__codelineno-0-1 name=__codelineno-0-1 href=#__codelineno-0-1></a>[fan]

Means, it might work in an on/off state only.<br> Being able to control the speed and let it run at e.g. 40% instead of 100% is caused by the PWM control of the fan.<br> PWM (= pulse width modulation) basically is (usually) being realized by switching the GND of the fan's connection on and off in a certain frequency. </p> <p>However, the problem with this is that a) not all fans work fine with this (generally speaking) and b) that some fans work better with a high frequency and other work better with a low frequency. <br> The frequency which is set in the stock firmware is 20kHz - which is pretty high. So if you get yourself a different fan and you can't control it's speed properly, the first thing to have a look at is trying to change the frequency which is being used for PWM.<br> Now this isn't easy to change with the stock firmware, as that would mean that you'd have to recompile the sources of the stock Marlin firmware after changing the belonging settings. But as we can run Klipper just fine on these machines, this would be the comfortable solution to test different frequencies (besides that, I personally <em>strongly</em> recommend using Klipper anyway..). </p> <p>So my suggestion would be: flash Klipper (see the chapter ["Klipper (MOD)")(firmware/fw_klipper.md)), set everything up for your specific machine and once everything is running fine, try different frequencies for the part cooling fan.<br> The belonging section in the <code>printer.cfg</code> for the part cooling fan is this:<br> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><a id=__codelineno-3-1 name=__codelineno-3-1 href=#__codelineno-3-1></a>[fan]

Based on my personal experience, I'd suggest to maybe print this one with the stock setup first, mount it and then print another, even better fan duct design. </li> <li><a href=https://www.printables.com/de/social/443043-martin>Martin</a> created a <a href=https://www.printables.com/de/model/378928-anycubic-kobra-neo-fan-duct>replacement for the stock fan duct </a> of the <strong>Neo</strong> which is supposed to achieve better part cooling due to air flow from three sides.<br> He also created a <a href=https://www.printables.com/en/model/426167-kobra-neo-fan-duct-for-5015-fan/files>fan duct for a 5015 radial fan</a> which replaces the stock parts. </li> <li><a href=https://www.printables.com/de/@MariusAvasiloaie>Marius Avasiloaie</a> created a <a href=https://www.printables.com/de/model/498457-anycubic-kobra-neo-fan-duct>360° circular fan duct</a> as a replacement of the original fan duct.</li> <li><a href=https://www.printables.com/de/@KaanOkcu_682657>Kaan Okcu</a> created a <a href=https://www.printables.com/de/model/470004-anycubic-kobra-neo-fan-duct>180° fan duct</a> which replaces the stock fan duct. </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id=heatsink-cooling-fan>Heatsink Cooling Fan<a class=headerlink href=#heatsink-cooling-fan title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Both printers use the same type of heatsink/coldend cooling fan: 24V, 0.03A, 40x40x10mm, model "Coolcox CC4010L24S". </p> <p><img alt="Coolcox CC4010L24S" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_fan-heatsink_web.jpg></p> <hr> <p><a href=https://ko-fi.com/U6U5NPB51><img alt=ko-fi src=https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg></a> </p> </article> </div> </div> <a href=# class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8v12Z"/></svg> Back to top </a> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <nav class="md-footer__inner md-grid" aria-label=Footer> <a href=../bed/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--prev" aria-label="Previous: Bed" rel=prev> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 11v2H8l5.5 5.5-1.42 1.42L4.16 12l7.92-7.92L13.5 5.5 8 11h12Z"/></svg> </div> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Previous </span> Bed </div> </div> </a> <a href=../mainboard/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--next" aria-label="Next: Mainboard" rel=next> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Next </span> Mainboard </div> </div> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M4 11v2h12l-5.5 5.5 1.42 1.42L19.84 12l-7.92-7.92L10.5 5.5 16 11H4Z"/></svg> </div> </a> </nav> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy; 2023-2025 Ulf Dieckmann [ 3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de ] | <a href=https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/3d-printer title="3d printer icons">3d printer icon created by Freepik - Flaticon</a> <br> If you find this page useful, please consider recommending it to others.
